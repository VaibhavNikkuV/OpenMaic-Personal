# Hosted Mode

Use this when the user has an access code for a hosted Drishti AI Tutor deployment and wants to skip local setup.

## Access Code Setup

1. Read `accessCode` from skill config (`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` → `skills.entries.drishti.config.accessCode`).
2. If found, use it directly. Do not ask the user to paste the code into chat.
3. If not found, tell the user to add their access code to the config file:
   ```
   Edit ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json and set skills.entries.drishti.config.accessCode to your access code (starts with sk-).
   ```
   Wait for the user to confirm before continuing. Do not ask them to paste the code in chat.
4. Read the hosted deployment URL from `skills.entries.drishti.config.url` and verify connectivity: `GET {url}/api/health` with `Authorization: Bearer <access-code>`
   - On success: confirm connection and proceed to generation.
   - On failure (401): access code is invalid, ask the user to check or regenerate it and update the config file.
   - On failure (network): suggest checking network or trying local mode.

## Generating a Classroom

Follow the same generation flow as [generate-flow.md](generate-flow.md) with these differences:

- **Base URL**: taken from `skills.entries.drishti.config.url`
- **Authorization**: Include header `Authorization: Bearer <access-code>` on all API requests
- **Classroom URL**: `{url}/classroom/{id}`

### Feature Detection in Hosted Mode

Before generating, query `GET {url}/api/health` (with auth header) to check `capabilities`. Automatically include optional feature flags (`enableWebSearch`, `enableImageGeneration`, etc.) based on what the server supports. Do not send new fields if the server does not return `capabilities` (older version). This ensures forward compatibility — the hosted instance may update on a different schedule than the local codebase.

## Quota

- If the deployment enforces a daily quota and generation returns 403 with `Daily quota exhausted`, inform the user of the limit and that it resets at midnight.

## Error Handling

| HTTP Status | Meaning | Action |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| 401 | Invalid access code | Ask user to check their code or generate a new one and update the config file |
| 403 | Quota exhausted | Inform daily limit, suggest trying tomorrow |
| 500 | Server error | Suggest retrying later or switching to local mode |
